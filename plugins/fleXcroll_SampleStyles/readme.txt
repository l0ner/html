About fleXcroll example styles:
The HTML, the CSS and the script file is best viewed using a proper text editor.
All .js files are the same, differences are made using CSS, and sometimes HTML.

You can find the non-compressed, readable version of the fleXcroll script inside the folder:
recommended_styles/fullimage-commented-uncompressed
The other examples contain a compressed version of the script for faster loading.


I prefer to use Scintilla text editor for my CSS, HTML, and script codings:

6) Fixed height transparent (vertical scrollbar only)
-fleXcroll adapts to your CSS, this is an example of you can have fixed height
scrollbars with nothing more than a simple CSS trick. No arguments,
no variables. Same trick could be applied to horizontal scrollbars.


7) Always display
-Have the scrollbase visible even when there isn't enough content to create a scrollbar.


8) Using alpha pngs
-Using alpha pngs is very straight-forward for advanced browsers,
but not for Internet Explorer 6. This example shows you the necessary trick
to get things done in IE6. Internet Explorer 7 does not need any special attention.


9) Scrollbar on opposite side
-Placing the vertical scrollbar on the left instead of right.
Not always recommended, but you never know when you might need to go for such a look.


10) Using float stacks inside your scroll area
-Just a reminder that you need to manually clear floats at the end of the div for
fleXcroll to properly evaluate the content size, for the law abiding browsers.

11) NEW: Horizontal liquid layouts and fleXcroll.
-fleXcroll should work OK with percentage widths on modern browsers, but IE6 needs a fix to display percentage widths correctly.

12) fleX-Ticker (
-News-ticker module, a nice accessible, user controllable, user friendly news-ticker.
Serves as an example of what can be done using fleXcroll, using only a few lines
of code.
